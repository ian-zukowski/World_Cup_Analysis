## Questions to Answer:
1. Have goals generally increased or decreased from cup-to-cup? Do they generally increase or decrease at different stages of the tournament?
2. Which country had the best performance while acting as host for that year's World Cup?
3. Which host city has seen the most exciting matches? Which host city has been the most disappointed with boring matches?
4. Are there any trends in attendance? (Cup-to-Cup, City-to-City, Stage-to-Stage)
5. What is the best performance each country has ever had while participating in the World Cup?
6. On average, which teams make it to the furthest stage in each World Cup?
7. Which teams have appeared in the most World Cups?
8. Which teams have advanced past the group stage the most?
9. Which matchups are the most common/have the most history for each team?
10. Which matchups have each team struggled with the most/could be considered their biggest rivalrys?
11. Which team has scored the most total goals in all of their World Cup appearances?
12. Which team averages the most goals for/against in their matches?
13. Which teams have pulled off the most comeback wins after being down at 45 minutes?

## Results:

### 1. Have goals generally increased or decreased from cup-to-cup? Do they generally increase or decrease at different stages of the tournament?

1a. To answer the first part of this question, it appears goals have trended downwards each year, with a peak in 1950 as can be seen below. Interestingly we can break this data down even further and filter by half and by winners/losers to see more trends. For instance, the average goals by losing teams has remained relatively stable around 1 goal in a loss, while the average goals for winning teams is what seems to be trending downwards, from 4 goals in the 30's/40's to 3 goals in the modern day. Essentially the data shows that matches are getting closer, either due to weaker offense from winning teams or stronger defense from losing teams.

1b. To answer the second part of the question, the losing teams appear to consistently score more and more goals as the tournament progresses, likely due to the fact that weaker offensive teams have been eliminated and do not participate in the later stages. However the winning team goal trend is not as straightforward, as it dips to its lowest point in the middle of the tournament before rising to a peak in the final stages. The consistent rise from Round of 16 through the Finals can likely be explained in a similar fashion, with better teams making it further in the tournmanet. The anamoly in the group stages however may be in part to the weakest teams being present, and are much more likely to lose by the largest margins (i.e. more 'blowout' wins are possible here).
